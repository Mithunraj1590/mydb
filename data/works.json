    "challenges": "The project faced significant technical hurdles including legacy Sass deprecation warnings from outdated @import syntax that were causing build issues. The complex filter functionality required a modular component architecture that wasn't initially in place. Additionally, specific UI/UX design requirements for the filter sidebar and course listing needed careful implementation. Ensuring responsive design consistency across all devices and managing filter states between components presented further complexity",
    "solutions": "We modernized the entire Sass architecture by migrating from deprecated @import to modern @use syntax and replaced the deprecated darken() function with color.adjust(). The filter functionality was completely refactored into a dedicated FilterSidebar component for better modularity. We implemented collapsible filter sections with proper styling and interactive elements. A custom responsive framework was built using mixins and breakpoint systems. The component communication was handled through Vue's event-driven architecture using $emit for clean parent-child interactions.",
    "results": "The transformation resulted in a completely clean build system with all Sass deprecation warnings eliminated and significantly improved build performance. The codebase became highly modular with reusable components and clean separation of concerns. The user experience was dramatically enhanced with an intuitive filter interface featuring expandable sections and real-time updates. The platform now works seamlessly across all devices with fully responsive design. The final codebase is highly maintainable with clear component hierarchy and comprehensive documentation, providing a solid foundation for future development and scalability.",

    "solutions": "To resolve the dependency conflicts, we implemented --legacy-peer-deps flag during npm installation to bypass peer dependency restrictions. For the CSS compilation issues, we systematically converted all problematic // comments to proper /* */ CSS comments across multiple SCSS files and replaced CSS custom properties with hardcoded values in the main stylesheet.
