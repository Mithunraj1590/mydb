The filter functionality was completely refactored into a dedicated FilterSidebar component for better modularity. We implemented collapsible filter sections with proper styling and interactive elements. A custom responsive framework was built using mixins and breakpoint systems. The component communication was handled through Vue's event-driven architecture using $emit for clean parent-child interactions."
